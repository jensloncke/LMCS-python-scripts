# LMCS-python-scripts
This repository contains a **collection of scripts written in Python** that automate data analysis steps of quantitative experiments performed at the Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Signaling (LMCS: https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000618/50753344 )  

## Purpose of this repository
This repository contains a **collection of scripts in the Python programming language** to automate quantitative data analysis.

# How to run these scripts:

To run these scripts:
* Get a working installation of Python, preferably via an Anaconda distribution from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution , or install base Python from : https://www.python.org/ .
* Install a Python IDE, preferably PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
* Open the Anaconda Prompt and create a new conda environment. More info on creating a conda environment here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
* Via the Anaconda Prompt, install the packages that are necessary to run your intended scripts. 
	* e.g. to create a new environment "myenv", in which you install the package "pandas", type:
		*conda create -n myenv
		*conda activate myenv
		*conda install pandas
* Set the Python interpreter to the newly created conda environment:
